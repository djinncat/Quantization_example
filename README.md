# Quantization_example
MATLAB
Assessment 1 for course Digital Signal Processing. This repository holds some MATLAB code that will quantize a recording. It is broken up into sections and the num_bits variable can be changed (as noted in commenting) to change the quantization level. The results are output as a graph for visual appreciation.
